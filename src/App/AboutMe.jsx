          Hey, I'm Adriana. At the moment I'm living in Berlin/Germany. I would
          like to share with you my experience traveling throughout the world.
          <br />
          That means tips, not only of life in Germany but also in other
          countries. Welcome to my page, I hope that it helps you to find
          something good for your life and travel.
          <br />
          <br />
          Enjoy ðŸ™ƒ
        </p>
