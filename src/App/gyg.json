After being picked up right at the hotel, there was a very well planned route to all the sights and with enough breaks and refreshments in between. There are some climbs, but the tour is easy to manage even for the untrained. Sturdy shoes and, if necessary, weatherproof clothing are recommended. We were a well mixed group and tour guide Jan made the day perfect with his charming and attentive manner. 100% recommend!"

      "review": "The trip was very informative. Bruce and Elvio are particularly very helpful. Bruce knew a lot and he was giving the information not only about the places we are going to but also on places that we passed by. He is also very good at making instructions for our meeting place and his approach to discussing points of interest were well planned and at the end you realize he is giving you mental cues to the places so that they are relevant to you and that makes it easy to track where we need to go to and meet up at the end of the day and avoids us being lost in a new place. Very clever and well organized indeed :) Will definitely join tours again with them :)"
