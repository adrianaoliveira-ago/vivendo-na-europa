      "review": "The trip was very informative. Bruce and Elvio are particularly very helpful. Bruce knew a lot and he was giving the information not only about the places we are going to but also on places that we passed by. He is also very good at making instructions for our meeting place and his approach to discussing points of interest were well planned and at the end you realize he is giving you mental cues to the places so that they are relevant to you and that makes it easy to track where we need to go to and meet up at the end of the day and avoids us being lost in a new place. Very clever and well organized indeed :) Will definitely join tours again with them :)"
